# FootballResult

* The solution uses .NET 7.
* I use LINQ for Parsing and sorting
* I use List to score teams' statistics and take advantage of Linq to quick lookups and updates.

Improvements:
* If I had more time, I would like to improve the GetMatchesScores; remove some if/else and remove switch/case
   I would like to improve Big O Notation Complexities and time Complexities; removing some LINQ methods
