# FootballResult

* The solution uses .NET 7.
* I use LINQ for Parsing and sorting
* I use List to scores of teams statistics and advantage of linq to quick lookups and updates.

Improvements:
* If I more time,i would like to improve the GetMatchesScores; remove some if/else and remove switch/case
   I would like to improve Big O Notation Complexities and time Complexities; removing some LINQ methods
